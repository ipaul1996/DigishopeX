								+ "web services that can handle various operations of an E-commerce "
								+ "website. There are three types of users - Admin, Customer, and "
								+ "Guest-user, each with their own set of privileges and functionalities.\r\n"
								+ "Admins have the highest level of access and can perform a wide "
								+ "range of operations, such as registering as an admin, "
								+ "creating product categories, adding products to categories, "
								+ "manipulating a list of products, registering suppliers and shippers, "
								+ "and changing their active status, viewing and tracking orders, "
								+ "obtaining sales analysis, and viewing bestselling products. "
								+ "These features give admins complete control over the E-commerce website, "
								+ "allowing them to manage products, suppliers, and customers efficiently.\r\n"
								+ "Customers can register themselves on the platform and view available categories "
								+ "and products, sort and filter products according to their preferences, add, update, "
								+ "and delete products from their cart, place orders, cancel orders, and request returns. "
								+ "Customers can also track their order status, rate products, and access other "
								+ "functionalities that are specific to them.\r\n"
								+ "Guest-users, who have not registered on the platform, also have access to some limited "
								+ "features such as viewing available products and sorting and filtering products.\r\n"
								+ "The application is secured with Spring Security, which provides robust authentication and "
								+ "authorization mechanisms to ensure that users are only able to access the functionalities that "
								+ "they are authorized to use. CORS feature is also incorporated so that the web services can be "
								+ "accessed through any type of client, making it easier for users to interact with the application.\r\n"
								+ "Overall, this RESTful web service provides extensive functionalities to perform various CRUD "
								+ "operations required in an E-commerce application"
